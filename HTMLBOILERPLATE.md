# How to write an HTML Boilerplate

## A few words before we get into it

I can write in **bold**, _italic_, or ***both***!

This wouldn't be so impressive without some other features:
* like an unordered list
2. and ordered list
- as well as different ways to create an unordered list, such as typing ``*`` vs ``-`` to initiate the list
- Oh, look at that. I just used a codesnippet, too!
5. Of course, this woulnd't be complete without some multi-line code snippets:
```Javascript
const useJavascript = () => {

}
```
6. I even wrote some multi-line code snippets in Pyton:
```Python
keys_list = ['A', 'B', 'C']
values_list = ['blue', 'red', 'bold']

#There are 3 ways to convert these two lists into a dictionary
#1- Using Python's zip, dict functionz
dict_method_1 = dict(zip(keys_list, values_list))

#2- Using the zip function with dictionary comprehensions
dict_method_2 = {key:value for key, value in zip(keys_list, values_list)}

#3- Using the zip function with a loop
items_tuples = zip(keys_list, values_list) 
dict_method_3 = {} 
for key, value in items_tuples: 
    if key in dict_method_3: 
        pass # To avoid repeating keys.
    else: 
        dict_method_3[key] = value
```

I got this code from this [site](https://builtin.com/data-science/python-code-snippets). No plagiarizing here. :innocent: 
 >I'm not sure why that emoji didn't work, but at least I get to use blockquote now.

 Some other cool features are below:

 | Feature | Cool-level |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Table | ~~Pretty~~ Cool |
| Task Lists | Cool ~~if browser-supported~~ |

3. [] Nope, but not done anyway
